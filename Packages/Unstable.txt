Description:Run ABC Compiler from command line (in a taskwindow)
 Modern versions of ABC have an attractive wimp interface, but you can't call them from
 the command line. To a limited extent ABCCLI fixes this.
 Using ABCCLI you can call ABC from within a taskwindow, a Makefile being run in a
 taskwindow or a TaskObey file. You cannot use it from obey files, or from a non-desktop
 context.

Standards-Version:0.1.0.0
Version:1.12
Description:Add/Remove LM98 file suffixes
 On RISC OS filing systems all files can have a 12bit filetype number associated
 with them. Other operating systems don't support this RISC OS specific metadata.
 One way to preserve the filetype information on other systems is to append the
 filetype to the filename, this is what the LanMan98 format does.
 LM98Util is a utility to add or remove LanMan98 type file suffixes to/from
 files in a specified directory and recursively through any subdirectories.

Description:Convert BASIC file to Absolute AIF
 MakeApp3 adds a wrapper to a BASIC file making it into
 an absolute file with a vaild AIF header which can be
 run in exactly the same manner as a compiled C application.
 Unlike other wrappers this one can be run from the command
 line, supports passing long command lines to the BASIC
 program and encrypting the BASIC program to disguise its
 contents.

Standards-Version:0.1.0.0
Version:1.12
Description:Add AIF header to program
 WrapAIF takes an absolute file without an AIF header or an untyped file with
 load/exec addresses and adds a dummy header plus a small stub of code (which
 copies the program back to it's original address, before running)
 RISC OS 6 now requires all absolute files to have valid AIF headers.
 Unfortunately not all programming languages/environments can generate them,
 which is where this program comes in useful.
 From v0.30 WrapAIF also adds headers to transient utilities.
